# Learning Roadmap

This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebooks designed to teach core Python concepts step-by-step.

Recommended learning path (start here and follow the order):

1. `gswpython.ipynb` — Core introduction and foundation (printing, data types, operators, control flow, strings, basic I/O). Start here if you're new to Python.
2. `gswjupyter.ipynb` — How to use Jupyter notebooks, magics, and notebook workflow (useful early so you can run and edit the other labs comfortably).
3. `var_&_ope.ipynb` — Variables, arithmetic and logical operators, type checking and examples.
4. `Built.ipynb` — Short reference for built-in functions you will use frequently (`round`, `len`, `min`, `max`, `sorted`, `pow`, `isinstance`, etc.).
5. `div.ipynb` — Small helper examples for `divmod`, `pow`, `input` processing and sorting examples.
6. `gswlists.ipynb` — Lists (creation, indexing, slicing, methods, comprehensions, nested lists and matrix examples).
7. `gswtuple.ipynb` — Tuples (immutable sequences, unpacking, slicing and converting to/from lists).
8. `gswsets.ipynb` — Sets (unique elements, membership, and set operations such as union, intersection, difference).
9. `gswdict.ipynb` — Dictionaries (key/value basics, methods, nested dicts, comprehensions and conversions).
10. `gswfunctions.ipynb` — Functions (definition, calling, args/kwargs, *args/**kwargs, scope, return values, lambda).
